# Front-end Style Guide

Your challenge is to build out this notifications page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications

See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
